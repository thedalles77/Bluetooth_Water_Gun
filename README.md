# Bluetooth_Water_Gun
The Bluefruit Connect phone app from Adafruit talks to a Bluefruit LE UART Friend which is tied to the Rx/Tx pins
on a Teensy (or Arduino). The Teensy program "Water_Gun.ino" receives the commands from the phone app to turn on
the water pump in a squirt gun. See the PDF file for a complete description.
